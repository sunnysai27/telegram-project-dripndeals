# DripDeals - Real-Time E-Commerce Deal Aggregator

DripDeals is a full-stack web application designed to aggregate the best e-commerce deals from a private Telegram channel and display them to users in real-time. This project leverages a Node.js backend to listen to a Telegram client, parse unstructured message data, and instantly push new deals to a modern React frontend using WebSockets.

**Live Site:** https://dripndeals.vercel.app

##  Features

* **Real-Time Deal Feed:** New deals from the Telegram channel appear on the website instantly without needing a page refresh, using  **Socket.IO**.
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** A Node.js service connects directly to the Telegram API, automatically parsing messages to extract structured data like product titles, prices, and URLs.
* **Dynamic Image Handling:** Automatically downloads media from messages, uploads it to **Cloudinary**, and handles deals with or without images gracefully on the frontend.
* **Server-Side Filtering & Pagination:** Efficiently browse deals by store (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.). The API is paginated to handle thousands of deals without compromising performance.
* **Responsive UI:** A clean and modern user interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, fully responsive for all screen sizes.
* **Shimmer Loading States:** A professional user experience with shimmer loading effects while deals are being fetched from the API.

    cd dripdeals/backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
    ```
    PORT=4000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
    API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash

    ```
    Follow the prompts in your terminal to enter your phone number and login code. After a successful login, a session string will be printed to the console. Copy this string and paste it into the `SESSION_ID` variable in your `.env` file.
5.  **Run the backend server:**

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add the backend URL:
    ```
    VITE_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:4000
